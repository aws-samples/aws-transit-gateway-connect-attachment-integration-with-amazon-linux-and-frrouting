## Transit Gateway Connect Attachment with GREoBGP with Linux and FRRouting

Often times customers struggle to test TGW Connect attachment functionality as it requires them to procure 3rd party SD-WAN virtual appliances from Marketplace, obtain eval licenses etc some of these steps are very time consuming, setups are complex and prevents customers from testing this very important feature of TGW which is very commonly used nowadays to seamlessly integrate with SD-WAN fabrics.

The intent of this GitHub samples is to show how easy and seamlessly they can implement TGW Connect using Amazon Linux and FRRouting (FRR) which is a free and open source Internet routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix platforms which supports all features of BGP. Customers will not need any license and can configure and do the testing at free of cost (only pay for the underlying EC2 instance); once they are comfortable with the concept they can then choose to implement any of the 3rd party vendor solutions of their choice.
